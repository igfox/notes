Hi everyone, my name is Ian (he/him/his). I just wrapped up grad school at the University of Michigan and am excited to be starting off at Facebook working as a Research Scientist in the applied AI group. I really enjoy working on applications of AI and ML. Outside of that I enjoy hiking, reading, playing board/videogames and have recently taken up jogging.

	2.  Build new experiences tha meaningfully improve peoples lives
	3. Support the millions of businesses that depend on facebook
	4. Communicate more transparently
Agency is big

### Vision
Alex Schultz:
	what resonates with you?
	What are your takeaways?
	Do you understand Facebooks vision?
	What are the best things you can do to make sure Facebook is successful?

when you're connected to someone different, it makes it harder to be intolerant 
When you give people power, it's radical
The services are amoral
talking about Rohingya
	not enough focus on national diversity
	Jawi speech not encoded in unicode, couldn't detect hate speech
tilt to positive uses, away from negative uses
what is good: a world brought closer together
focusing on impact is the most important thing for career
KakaoTalk, WhatsApp, Onavo
Jon Combe (WhatsApp?)
messenger went from declining to 10x
Hard long term project: break it up into 6 month chunks
Is facebook ever going to diversify from ads?
	Great business model, high margin
	don't want to go away from ads
	diversified across economy
AR/VR:
	want to control next OS development, make it people-centric
	not interested in high-margin hardware
Are ads good for world?
	Ads are amoral

PSC: performance summary cycle

### Values
5 values to guide decision making
	not aspirational, give baselines for decision making
what are ways you need to move and learn fast
Believe in mission and values, that's where you want to spend your time

Build Social Value
	We make money so we can build products and services that build social value in the lives of community
	
Move Fast
	used to end with 'and break things'
	now: with stable infrastructure
	intern shutting down one server brought down everything
	'process' evolved from dirty word
	first 6 months: move fast is learn fast
	Feedback: ask for lots is better, get specific
	in one-on-one, ask for feedback up front
	focus on curiosity, understanding, asking questions

Be Bold
	play to win, not to not lose
	don't protect yourself
	
Focus on Impact
	way more work than people to do it
	it's not prioritization if it's not painful
	don't mistake motion for progress

Be Open
	give lot of info about things coming up
	transparency is critical and expected from everyone
	you can't be your best self if you're hiding who you are, invite people to bring their real selves and bring yourself

### Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity important to build products that support 3 billion people
Only new musical instrument in last century: Steel Drum
Very hard to manage differences
	Simple problems: homogenous teams are better
	Complex problems: diverse teams
Identity formed from things born, choices, and [something]
Workplaces: have to get stuff done, can lead to 'closing off', leave most of yourself at home and just bring work stuff
An experiment in openness, might fail
You can't engineer people issues
Racism didn't happen organically, so anti-racism can't be organic
Diverse Slate Approach: won't hire unless you consider a diverse applicant
